    <center><h2>ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA SCIENCE</h2></center>
    <br />
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">
      <span style="color: darkviolet;">
        Artificial intelligence (AI) and data science</span
      >
      are two very different things. Artificial intelligence is the process of
      creating machines that can think like humans, or at least mimic human
      behavior in some way. Data science is the application of techniques from
      statistics, mathematics, computer programming and other fields to solve
      real-world problems using information technology. Artificial intelligence
      (AI) is a term used to describe the simulation of human intelligence
      processes in machines. It typically involves sophisticated algorithms that
      enable computers to perform tasks that normally require human
      intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition and decision
      making. However, AI can be applied in many more areas than just these
      three specific processes. Data science is a field of knowledge which
      applies advanced statistical and mathematical techniques to large datasets
      in order to extract knowledge from them that was previously not there.
      This data can be structured like a spreadsheet but can also be
      unstructured like text or video data.
